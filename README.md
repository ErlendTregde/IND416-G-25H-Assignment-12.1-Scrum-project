# IND416-G-25H-Assignment-12.1-Scrum-project

Overview

The objective of this assignment is to equip you with the knowledge and skills to create sprint plans. During the assignment, you will have the opportunity to practice and apply your skills by creating stories, assembling them into a product backlog, refining them to produce a sprint plan, and performing a mock sprint that involves moving stories across your Kanban board as your team would do in a real sprint.

What should you deliver for this assignment?

Read the scenario, then check and follow the Instructional Tasks below. Prepare a (max) two-page report of what you did, how you did it, and what challenges you faced in your Scrum scenario. The report should have the link to your Kanban board. See an example instructions for sharing the link to the Kanban board here.

Project Scenario

In this scenario, you will play the roles of a product owner, scrum master, customer, and developer in your group (if your group has three members, you can skip the role of customer). The product owner will create stories for your team and organize these stories into a product backlog. The Scrum master will create a sprint milestone and ensure that a subset of the stories is ready to be placed in a sprint plan. The developer will create the sprint backlog and execute some of the stories by moving them across the Kanban board in a simulated sprint. The customer will be in touch with the product owner.

Your team has been tasked with developing the backend product catalog for an e-commerce website. What is product catalog in e-commerce? Read here (https://www.paperflite.com/blogs/product-catalog#:~:text=A%20product%20catalog%20is%20a,%2C%20customer%20reviews%2C%20and%20moreLinks to an external site.). Stakeholders requires the ability to create, retrieve, update, and delete products from the catalog, along with features like indicating product likes and hosting on a cloud environment with automated deployments.

Your team will use a Kanban board to create a backlog and sprint plan for this work. Use the videos in Module 5 Part I to learn how to create a new GitHub repository and Kanban board and fill the Kanban board with issues that will become user stories.

Note:
-If you have used Zenhub before to create a Kanban board, and you prefer it to GitHub, you may also use Zenhub for this project.

Stakeholder Requirements

These are the requirements from your stakeholders that you should use to create the user stories on the Kanban board.

Need the ability to create a product in the catalog.
Need the ability to retrieve a product from the catalog.
Need the ability to update a product in the catalog.
Need the ability to delete a product from the catalog.
Need the ability to Like a product in the catalog.
Need the ability to Dislike a product in the catalog.
Need the ability to list all products in the catalog.
Need the ability to query a subset of products in the catalog.
Must be hosted in the cloud.
Must have automation to deploy new changes to the cloud.
Instructional Tasks

To help you finish this project, I have provided a list of instructional tasks to guide you:

Create a new GitHub repository called agile-project and ensure it is public.
Create a Project in your GitHub repository and name it Scrum Project.
Create an issue template for the new repository similar to the one presented in videos.
Create issues for the stakeholder requirements listed above (10 in total). Fill in the As a… I need… So that… section of the template.
Move requirements 7 and 8 issues into the Icebox.
Move the remaining issues into the Product Backlog.
Conduct a Backlog Refinement meeting and rank the Product Backlog to match the requirements order.
Update the top 5 stories in the Product Backlog with acceptance criteria following the Gherkin Given… When… Then… syntax.
Create a technical debt label.
Add labels of either enhancement or technical debt to all stories in the Product Backlog.
Create a sprint milestone with a duration of 2 weeks, named Sprint.
Conduct a Sprint Planning meeting. Add the top 4 stories to the sprint, assign them to the sprint milestone, and assign story point estimates. Move these 4 stories to the Sprint Backlog.
Simulate a sprint by assigning the top story to your group members. Move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story to Review/QA. Take the next story from the Sprint Backlog, assign it to your group, and move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Move the story from In Progress to Review/QA. Take the next story off the Sprint Backlog, assign it to your group, and move it to the In Progress column.

Move the story in Review/QA to Done. Leave the story in the In Progress column where it is. This marks the end of the sprint.

Ensure your burndown chart displays correctly.

Share the URL of your Kanban board for peer review.
